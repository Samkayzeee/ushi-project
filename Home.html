            <p class="para1">I am a professional website developer living in the United Kingdom. This website represents
                     my digital portfolio as it showcases my educational qualification, technologies I work with, 
                     and some cool projects I developed with HTML, CSS and ECMAScript (ES). As you scroll down 
                     to the fun section of this website, I shared a little information about my personal life.

    <!-- <h3 class="h31">My first Laptop</h3>? -->
    <p class="para2">I got my first laptop in 2008, a white 2007 LG's 13-inch S900 series laptop with: 512MB RAM size, a failing 80GB HDD, very low processor and graphics card <br>
        that could not efficiently support GTA Game.</p>
    <p class="para3">As if that was not enough, the internal speaker was failing that I had to consistently use headphones. I kept on managing it but little did I know that I was 
        unconsciously developing my computer hardware skills by occasionally repairing all the faulty components of the laptop - which I finally sold (6months 
        later) for triple the price I got it.</p>

            I leveraged the power of HTML5, CSS3 and 
            ECMAScript to design, develop, test and 
            deployed "Think of a number" and "Hangman" 
            games that conform to good design 
            standards. The games are really interesting to 
            play and I feel you will like them.
